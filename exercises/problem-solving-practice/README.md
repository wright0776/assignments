# Problem Solving Practice

In this exercise I used JavaScript to solve three problems:

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest (without using Math.max())

Write a function that takes an array of words and a character and return each word that has that letter present.

Write a function that takes a num1 and num2 and returns whether num1 is divisible by num2.
