# Practice Problems

In this exercise I used javascript to solve some simple problems using functions.

1. Make a function that takes a string and returns that string reversed.
2. Make a function that takes a string and returns true if the string could be a number else return false.
3. Make a function that takes a number and returns true if the number is even else return false.
4. Make a function that takes an array and returns the average of the array.
5. Make a function that takes two arrays and returns a single array of the items from the arrays added alternatingly.
