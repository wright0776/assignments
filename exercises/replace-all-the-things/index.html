                The first robots were officially given rights yesterday as part of historic legislation passed by a narrow vote in the house.
                No longer will robot kind suffer the injustices of humans. The
                <b>Robot Civil Rights Act</b> grants robots the same rights as all humans.

                The robot market on
                <i>Fifth Avenue and Market Street</i> caught fire as a result of overloaded circuits. The owner, Mr. Roboto,
                gave a short statement in which he said the market will be rebuilt and running as soon as possible. Although
                much was lost, the catastophe is an opportunity for a much needed update and remodel of the historic market.
