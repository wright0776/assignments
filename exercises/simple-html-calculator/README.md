# Simple HTML Calculator

In this exercise I created a calculator using hardcoded html, css styles, and a javascript document that did the actual adding. I learned how to better use event listeners and integrate html id's and values into my javascript to be manipulated.

This calculator has a simple add, subtract and multiply function with a button activating each. It also has reset buttons to reset the input and output fields.
