# Caeser Cipher

In this exercise I used readline-sync to take user input of a string to be encrypted.
I then took another user input of a number of characters to be shifted.
I then used a function to shift the individual characters of the string down the alphabet by the number the user gave me.
Spaces and punctuation are not changed in the output string.
