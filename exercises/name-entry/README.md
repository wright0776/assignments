# Name Entry App

This app is pretty simple. There is an input box, and a submit button. 

When text is entered in the input box, an h1 element appears above the box with the content of the input box. 

When the enter key is pressed, or the submit button pushed, an alert is displayed saying `thanks [content of input box]!`
and the text submitted is added as a list item below the submit button. 

I used react to create this form which involved using state, class [syntax], props and various components
