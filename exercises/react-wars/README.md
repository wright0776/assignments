# React Wars

This exercise was to build a Single Page Application that implements React Router with Axios.

There is a sidebar of Link components displaying the character names retrieved from the star wars api. 

Star Wars API:  https://swapi.co/api/people/

Using a Switch component, the app displays each character's physical characteristics on a separate view for each link. Pretty cool!
