# Exercise - Loops

In this exercise I used loops to loop through strings and arrays looking for values with specific outlined parameters.

functions:

1. accepts a string as parameter and prints out each letter of the string individually.
2. accepts a string and a single character as inputs. outputs the first occurrence of the specified character.
3. accepts an array of numbers as a parameter and outputs "found" if the number 42 is found.
4. accepts an array of 10 numbers and prints out the smallest number of the ten.
