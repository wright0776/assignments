# Todo Express

This is a simple server to store todos and compile a todo list. 
When a new todo is posted, a unique id for that todo is generated (using the uuid npm package).

It uses: 

express,
uuid,
body-parser

It allows:

new todo items to be posted to the array,
allows the entire list of todos,
allows the user to update a todo by its _id,
allows the user to delete a todo by its _id, and
allows the user retrieve a single todo by its _id.
