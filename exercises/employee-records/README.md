# Employee Records
### Project Source:
https://coursework.vschool.io/employee-records/

### Project Info:
In this project, I used constructor functions to create an employee database, which is just an array of objects.

The constructor function creates a new employee with 4 parameters as values:

Name
Job title
Salary
Status

There is also a method in the object that allows you to print the individual employee's data to the console when called
and there is a method that is automatically run in the object that adds the newly created employee to the employees array.
