# Thing Finder

This exercise is a server that uses the following: 

express
uuid
body-parser

The server is meant to hold an array of shirts and then return data based on shirts that have a type, color, material, or other properties. The properties added can be anything, as long as its in JSON format. 

It handles the ability to search for items based on properties of objects passed in using a query in the header of the request.
