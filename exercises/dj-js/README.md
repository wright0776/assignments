# DJ JS

In this exercise I used even listeners and get methods to manipulate styles in my document based on mouse actions.
Here are the style changes:

- the button goes blue when the mouse hovers over it
- it changes to red when down clicked
- it changes to yellow when released
- it changes to green when double clicked
- it changes to orange when the page is scrolled
