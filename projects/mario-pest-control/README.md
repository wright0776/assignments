# Mario Pest Control

This project is a tool for Mario to use for his pest control business.

It takes in number values for how many of the different pests Mario catches, outputs subtotals for coins based on the each type of pest caught, and also gives a grand total of coins owed.

For this project I used I html and css for format and styling and then used javascript to do the math and output the subtotals and total.
