# Colossal Adventure RPG
========================================

This is an RPG game called The Forest of Endless Doom

Once the game starts, you have no choice but to enter the forest.

Once you enter the forest, you have to defeat three enemies to get out.

The enemies range from Factory Farms to Donald Trumps and when you defeat an enemy you recieve an item and regenerate 20 hp.

The game is made using javascript and readline-sync. It was a great opportunity for me to work with objects and functions that manipulate them. I also utilized constructor functions in this project.
