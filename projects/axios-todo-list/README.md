# To-Do List

In this project I used JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS to make a to-do list app. The app saves list items to an API so you can always access them even if you close the page.

You can add 4 things to new to-do's when you add them:

- title
- description
- price
- image url

The image will automatically populate off the url you provide and the rest will add as you give it. If you check the to-do as completed, a line will mark through it and it will be noted on the API that the item is completed so that if you close the page and reload it, the item will still show as checked off and completed.

I used Axios to access the API and worked with JavaScript to do the functionality and talk to the DOM to alter the HTML and CSS.
